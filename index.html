                <li onclick="toggleDetails(this)">Lesson 1: Newton's Laws
                    <div class="lesson-details">Newton's First Law of Motion Newton's First Law of Motion states that an object in motion tends to stay in motion unless an external force acts upon it. Similarly, if the object is at rest, it will remain unless an unbalanced force acts upon it. Newton's First Law of Motion is also known as the Law of Inertia. What Newton's First Law is saying is that objects behave predictably. If a ball is sitting on your table, it isn't going to start rolling or fall off the table unless a force acts upon it to cause it to do so. Moving objects don't change their direction unless a force causes them to move from their path. As you know, if you slide a block across a table, it eventually stops rather than continuing forever. This is because the frictional force opposes the continued movement. If you throw a ball out in space, there is much less resistance. The ball will continue onward for a much greater distance. Newton's Second Law of Motion Newton's Second Law of Motion states that when a force acts on an object, it will cause the object to accelerate. The larger the object's mass, the greater the force will need to be to cause it to accelerate. This Law may be written as force = mass x acceleration or: F = m * a Another way to state the Second Law is to say it takes more force to move a heavy object than it does to move a light object. Simple, right? The law also explains deceleration or slowing down. You can think of deceleration as acceleration with a negative sign on it. For example, a ball rolling down a hill moves faster or accelerates as gravity acts on it in the same direction as the motion (acceleration is positive). If a ball is rolled up a hill, the force of gravity acts on it in the opposite direction of the motion (acceleration is negative or the ball decelerates). Newton's Third Law of Motion Newton's Third Law of Motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that pushing on an object causes that object to push back against you, the same amount but in the opposite direction. For example, when you are standing on the ground, you are pushing down on the Earth with the same magnitude of force it is pushing back up at you. History of Newton's Laws of Motion Sir Isaac Newton introduced the three Newton's laws of motion in 1687 in his book entitled "Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica" (or simply "The Principia"). The same book also discussed the theory of gravity. This one volume described the main rules still used in classical mechanics today..</div> </li> <li onclick="toggleDetails(this)">Lesson 2: Energy <div class="lesson-details">The concept of energy is key to science and engineering. Here is the definition, examples of energy, and a look at the way it is classified. Energy Definition In science, energy is the ability to do work or heat objects. It is a scalar physical quantity, which means it has magnitude, but no direction. Energy is conserved, which means it can change from one form to another, but isn‚Äôt created or destroyed. There are many different types of energy, such as kinetic energy, potential energy, light, sound, and nuclear energy. Word Origin and Units The term ‚Äúenergy‚Äù comes from the Greek word energeia or from the French words enmeaning in and ergon which means work. The SI unit of energy is the joule (J), where 1 J = 1‚Äékg‚ãÖm2‚ãÖs‚àí2. Other units include the kilowatt-hour (kW-h), British thermal unit (BTU), calorie (c), kilocalorie (C), electron-volt (EV), erg, and foot-pound (ft-lb). What Losing Energy Means One form of energy may be converted into another without violating a law of thermodynamics. Not all of these forms of energy are equally useful for practical applications. When energy is ‚Äúlost‚Äù, it means the energy can‚Äôt be recaptured for use. This usually occurs when heat is produced. Losing energy doesn‚Äôt mean there is less of it, only that it has changed forms. Energy may be either renewable or nonrenewable. Photosynthesis is an example of a process the produces renewable energy. Burning coal is an example of nonrenewable energy. The plant continues to produce chemical energy in the form of sugar, by converting solar energy. Once coal is burned, the ash can‚Äôt be used to continue the reaction. KineticEnergy and Potential Energy The various forms of energy are classified as kinetic energy, potential energy, or a mixture of them. Kinetic energy is energy of motion, while potential energy is stored energy or energy of position. The total of the sum of the kinetic and potential energy of a system is constant, but energy changes from one form to another. For example, when you hold an apple motionless above the ground, it has potential energy, but no kinetic energy. When you drop the apple, it has both kinetic and potential energy as it falls. Just before it strikes the ground, it has maximum kinetic energy, but no potential energy. Renewable and Non-Renewable Energy Another broad way of classifying energy is as renewable or non-renewable. Renewable energy is energy that replenishes within a human lifetime. Examples include solar energy, wind energy, and biomass. Non-renewable energy either does not regenerate or else takes longer than a human lifespan to do so. Fossil fuels are an example of non-renewable energy. Forms of Energy There are many different forms energy can take. Here are some examples: nuclear energy ‚Äì energy released by changes in the atomic nucleus, such as fission or fusion electrical energy ‚Äì energy based on the attraction, repulsion, and movement of electrical charge, such as electrons, protons, or ions chemical energy ‚Äì energy based on the difference between the amount required to form chemical bonds versus how much is needed to break them mechanical energy ‚Äì the sum of the translational and rotational kinetic and potential energies of a system gravitational energy ‚Äì energy stored in gravitational fields ionization energy ‚Äì energy that binds an electron to its atom or molecule magnetic energy ‚Äì energy stored within magnetic fields elastic energy ‚Äì energy of a material that causes it to return to its original shape if it‚Äôs deformed radiant energy ‚Äì electromagnetic radiation, such as light from the sun or heat from a stove thermal energy ‚Äì kinetic energy due to the motion of subatomic particles, atoms, and molecules</div>
